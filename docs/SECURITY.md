# Security Documentation

This document outlines the security measures implemented in this application and provides guidelines for maintaining security best practices.

## Overview

Our application implements multiple layers of security to protect against common web vulnerabilities and ensure data privacy. This document covers:

- Security Architecture
- Implemented Security Measures
- Security Testing
- Monitoring and Alerting
- Security Guidelines for Developers
- Incident Response Procedures

## Security Architecture

### Defense in Depth Strategy

Our security approach follows the "defense in depth" principle with multiple security layers:

1. **Frontend Security**: Input sanitization, CSP, secure headers
2. **Authentication Layer**: Secure authentication with Supabase Auth
3. **Data Layer**: Row Level Security (RLS) policies
4. **Transport Layer**: HTTPS, secure cookies
5. **Monitoring Layer**: Real-time threat detection and audit logging

### Security Components

#### 1. Input Sanitization (`src/lib/security.ts`)
- Comprehensive text sanitization
- HTML content sanitization
- Database input sanitization
- XSS prevention

#### 2. Enhanced Error Boundary (`src/components/security/EnhancedErrorBoundary.tsx`)
- Secure error handling
- Automatic retry mechanisms
- Error reporting without sensitive data exposure

#### 3. File Upload Security (`src/hooks/useEnhancedFileUpload.ts`)
- Multi-layer file validation
- Signature verification
- Malicious content scanning
- Rate limiting

#### 4. OAuth Security (`src/lib/secureOAuth.ts`)
- CSRF protection with state validation
- Secure state management
- Session security

#### 5. Audit Logging (`src/hooks/useAuditLogger.ts`)
- Comprehensive audit trails
- Security event logging
- Compliance monitoring

#### 6. Security Monitoring (`src/components/security/SecurityMonitor.tsx`)
- Real-time threat detection
- DOM mutation monitoring
- Network request monitoring

#### 7. Content Security Policy (`src/components/security/CSPProvider.tsx`)
- Strict CSP implementation
- Violation reporting
- Security headers

## Implemented Security Measures

### Authentication & Authorization
- Supabase Auth integration with secure session management
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies on all database tables
- JWT token validation
- Secure password requirements

### Input Validation & Sanitization
- Server-side input validation
- XSS prevention through sanitization
- SQL injection prevention
- File upload validation with signature checking

### Data Protection
- Encryption in transit (HTTPS)
- Secure cookie configuration
- Environment variable protection
- Sensitive data redaction in logs

### Security Headers
- Content Security Policy (CSP)
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
- Strict-Transport-Security
- Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin

### Rate Limiting
- User-based rate limiting
- IP-based rate limiting
- File upload rate limiting
- API request rate limiting

## Security Testing

### Automated Security Tests (`src/hooks/useSecurityTesting.ts`)

The application includes automated security testing that can be run to verify security measures:

```typescript
import { useSecurityTesting } from '@/hooks/useSecurityTesting';

const { runSecurityTests } = useSecurityTesting();
const results = await runSecurityTests();
```

#### Test Categories:
1. **Input Sanitization Tests**: Verify XSS prevention
2. **HTML Sanitization Tests**: Check HTML content filtering
3. **CSP Tests**: Validate Content Security Policy
4. **HTTPS Tests**: Ensure secure connections
5. **Authentication Tests**: Verify auth security
6. **DOM Security Tests**: Check for DOM manipulation vulnerabilities

### Manual Testing Checklist

Regular manual security testing should include:

- [ ] Authentication flow testing
- [ ] Input validation testing with malicious payloads
- [ ] File upload testing with malicious files
- [ ] Session management testing
- [ ] HTTPS certificate validation
- [ ] CSP violation testing
- [ ] Rate limiting verification

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Security Monitoring

The `SecurityMonitor` component provides real-time security monitoring:

- DOM mutation monitoring for injection attacks
- Network request monitoring for suspicious activity
- Console monitoring for security errors
- CSP violation detection

### Audit Logging

All security-relevant events are logged:

- Authentication events (login, logout, failed attempts)
- Data access events
- File operations
- Administrative actions
- Security violations
- Error events

### Alert Triggers

High-severity security events trigger immediate alerts:

- Critical security threats
- Multiple failed authentication attempts
- Malicious content detection
- CSP violations
- Suspicious file uploads

## Security Guidelines for Developers

### Input Handling
```typescript
// ✅ GOOD: Always sanitize user input
import { sanitizeText } from '@/lib/security';
const cleanInput = sanitizeText(userInput);

// ❌ BAD: Using raw user input
document.innerHTML = userInput;
```

### Database Queries
```typescript
// ✅ GOOD: Use Supabase client methods
const { data } = await supabase.from('table').select().eq('id', userId);

// ❌ BAD: Raw SQL queries
const query = `SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = '${userId}'`;
```

### File Uploads
```typescript
// ✅ GOOD: Use enhanced file upload
import { useEnhancedFileUpload } from '@/hooks/useEnhancedFileUpload';

// ❌ BAD: Direct file processing without validation
const reader = new FileReader();
reader.readAsText(file);
```

### Error Handling
```typescript
// ✅ GOOD: Use secure error boundary
import { EnhancedErrorBoundary } from '@/components/security/EnhancedErrorBoundary';

// ❌ BAD: Exposing sensitive error information
console.error('Database error:', error.message);
```

### Authentication
```typescript
// ✅ GOOD: Proper auth state management
import { useSecureAuth } from '@/hooks/useSecureAuth';

// ❌ BAD: Storing sensitive tokens in localStorage
localStorage.setItem('token', authToken);
```

## Common Vulnerabilities Prevention

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Input sanitization on all user inputs
- Content Security Policy implementation
- Secure templating practices

### SQL Injection
- Parameterized queries through Supabase client
- Input validation and sanitization
- RLS policies for data access control

### Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- SameSite cookie attributes
- CSRF tokens where applicable
- Origin validation

### Clickjacking
- X-Frame-Options: DENY header
- CSP frame-ancestors directive

### Information Disclosure
- Error message sanitization
- Secure logging practices
- Environment variable protection

## Incident Response Procedures

### Security Incident Classification

**Critical**: Data breach, authentication bypass, privilege escalation
**High**: XSS vulnerability, sensitive data exposure
**Medium**: Rate limiting bypass, information disclosure
**Low**: Security misconfiguration, policy violation

### Response Steps

1. **Detection**: Automated monitoring or manual discovery
2. **Assessment**: Determine severity and impact
3. **Containment**: Isolate affected systems
4. **Investigation**: Analyze logs and determine root cause
5. **Recovery**: Implement fixes and restore service
6. **Documentation**: Document incident and lessons learned
